# ShutdownReboot

A simple (exe) to reboot, shutdown, lock screen and sleep the computer.

Windows 64 bit required.

Compatibility: Win 7 , Win 8 , Win 8.1 , Win 10

Put the exe where you want and make a shortcut to desktop.

The icons files must be in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files" .

For all programs ESCAPE key will abort.

I make this for esay way to reboot and shutdown windows 8 and windows 10.
